        <h1>The next evolution of Scoutplan is coming!</h1>
        <section>
          <p>In the coming weeks we’ll be rolling out a new version of Scoutplan. All the features and functionality you’ve come to expect will be there, but with a fresh new look and feel.</p>

<p>Main navigation moves to the side and gets cleaned up:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/scoutplan_2_event_list.png" alt="Scoutplan event list view" /></p>

<p>Events now show in a separate window with a clean layout and an optional banner image. Buttons and other “calls to action” have a consistent look and feel so it’s obvious what you can do next:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/scoutplan_2_event_show.png" alt="Scoutplan single event view" /></p>

<p>The goal with this new version is the increase on-screen information density, standardize the design language so actions are consistent and obvious, modernize the application, and make it easier to move between different parts of the application. Data shows that most members access Scoutplan via mobile, so the Scoutplan mobile experience got extra attention. Plenty remains familiar in this new release, and I hope you’ll find the new Scoutplan more intuitive and easier to use.</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>

<p>Some of these user interface changes tee up new features we’re planning to add in the future (you see some of them in the screenshots above).
Here are some of the things in the hopper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-app notifications, offering an alternative to email and text messages.</li>
  <li>Meeting planner, where you can see all your unit meetings in one place and plan activities.</li>
  <li>Messaging, so you can send messages to your unit members without leaving Scoutplan.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="look-for-the-new-scoutplan-in-the-coming-weeks">Look for the new Scoutplan in the coming weeks</h2>

<p>To keep versioning simple, we’ll be calling this Scoutplan 2024.3.1 (year 2024, quarter 3, release 1). We’ll be rolling Scoutplan 2024.3.1 out in the coming weeks. Hope you enjoy it. Questions? Feedback? Let us know at <a href="mailto:info@scoutplan.org">info@scoutplan.org</a>.</p>
