# Infrastructure Security, and Privacty
Scoutplan runs on a Kubernetes cluster hosted at Digital Ocean. Data is encrypted at rest by Digital Ocean, and in transit via TLS, signified by the "https" in your browser address bar. Individual members are only able to access the unit, or units, to which they belong.

# Development
As of this writing, Scoutplan is developed solely by me, Ray Bradley. Scoutplan embraces the open source ethos and I welcome contributions. In fact, I'd love nothing more than to be one of many.

# What /isn't/ Scoutplan?

* An advancement system
* An accounting system
* A substitute for actual, in-person conversation ;)

# Why?
The Scouting movement in the United States is at a crossroads, facing unprecedented challenges from multiple angles. Budgets and staff are being reduced across the country, shifting the work of running an outstanding program onto volunteers. This isn't entirely a bad thing, but the model only succeeds when volunteers are enabled and empowered to do their jobs quickly and easily. A multitude of products have been launched over the years to tackle this problem. Scoutplan is yet another one, although it aims to be wholly modern in its approach, user experience, and technology stack.

# What about Scoutbook?
Scoutbook is, in fact, one of those products we just discussed. Scoutbook does a lot of things right; advancement is where it shines. Scoutplan aims to fill the event management and communication gap for Scout units. Scoutbook + Scoutplan = less administrative overhead for leaders, and more time to deliver great programs!
