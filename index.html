Gmail, Google calendar, Excel, SignUpGenius, text messaging...great products on their own, but a hassle to manage, share access, and keep updated.
Instead of doing the things you <em>want</em> to do to deliver a great program, you're stuck with administrative tasks â€” sending emails, answering
text messages, keeping track of who's coming to what event, maintaining your communication roster, updating calendars.</p><p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">Scoutplan is <strong class="font-bold">web software that's really good at those tedious tasks</strong>,
freeing you to work on what people do best: delivering a great program. At a time when volunteers matter more than ever, let's make it easy to focus
on what's most important. And because Scoutplan is made specifically for scouting, you can do a lot of things in one place, rather than stitching
together a bunch of tools.</p></section><section class="py-8 w-3/4" id="why"><h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">What's it do?</h2><ul class="list-disc leading-snug text-2xl font-light"><li class="mb-3">Sends a <strong class="font-bold">weekly "coming-up" email</strong> to your members.</li><li class="mb-3">Sends <strong class="font-bold">RSVP reminders</strong> to non-respondents.</li><li class="mb-3">Publishes your unit calendar so members can <strong class="font-bold">add it to their favorite calendar app.</strong></li><li class="mb-3">Lets you designate one or more <strong class="font-bold">event organizers</strong>, and then send your organizers a daily email when people RSVP to their events.</li><li class="mb-3">Members can download a <strong class="font-bold">printable PDF calendar</strong></li><li class="mb-3">Meeting planner lets you see your unit meetings in one view and decide what to do at each meeting.</li></ul></section><section class="py-4 w-3/4" id="more"><h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">What about Scoutbook?</h2><p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">While there's a bit of overlap, Scoutbook covers different ground by focusing on advancement. Scoutplan is entirely focused on <strong class="font-bold">event management and communication</strong>. Together, the two make a potent combination.</p><h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">How much does it cost?</h2><p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">Scoutplan is free for Scouts BSA packs, troops, crews, and ships. The author funds the project for his unit's use. If it's beneficial to others, so much the better!</p><h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">Is it secure? Is it reliable?</h2><p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">Yes and yes. Scoutplan is hosted at <a href="https://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a>, a leading and secure cloud provider. Traffic is encrypted via TLS using certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>. We use <a href="https://honeybadger.io">Honeybadger</a> and <a href="https://scoutapm.com">Scout APM</a> to monitor errors and performance. Server security configuration is checked weekly through <a href="https://ssllabs.com">Qualys SSL Labs</a>. As for reliability, Scoutplan was up and available 99.992% of the time in 2022, meaning it was down for less than one hour all year. Updates&mash;which are frequent&mdash;are made via Kubernetes rolling deployments for zero downtime.</p></section><section class="border-t py-4" id="open_source_partners"><h3 class="text-center font-bold text-xl">With Gratitude: Our Open Source Partners</h3><div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items: center;"><div style="padding:2rem;"><a href="https://scoutapm.com"><img src="/assets/img/sapm_vert_logo-black.png" width="150" /></a></div><div style="padding:2rem;"><a href="https://honeybadger.io"><img src="/assets/img/honeybadger_logo.png" width="150" /></a></div><div style="padding:2rem;"><a href="https://github.com"><img src="/assets/img/GitHub_Logo.png" width="150" /></a></div></section></main></body></html>
