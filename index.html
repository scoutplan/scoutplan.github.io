      <h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">Why Scoutplan?</h2>
      
      <p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">If
        you're like many Scouters, you're probably using a collection of tools to run your unit:
        Gmail, Google calendar, Excel, SignUpGenius, text messaging.
        All great products...that you have to administer. That's time you're not spending on a great Scouting program.</p>

      <p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">Scoutplan
        is <strong class="font-bold">web software that's really good at those tedious tasks</strong>, freeing you to do what you do best: delivering a great program.
        At a time when volunteers matter more than ever, let's make it easy to focus on what's most important.
        And because Scoutplan is made specifically for Scouting, you can do a lot of things in one place, rather than stitching together a bunch of tools.</p>

    <section class="py-8 w-3/4" id="why">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">What's it do?</h2>
      
      <ul class="list-disc leading-snug text-2xl font-light">
        <li class="mb-3">Sends a <strong class="font-bold">weekly "coming-up" email</strong> to your members.</li>
        <li class="mb-3">Sends <strong class="font-bold">RSVP reminders</strong> to non-respondents.</li>
        <li class="mb-3">Publishes your unit calendar so members can <strong class="font-bold">add it to their favorite calendar app.</strong></li>
        <li class="mb-3">Lets you designate one or more <strong class="font-bold">event organizers</strong>, and then send your organizers a daily email when people RSVP to their events.</li>
        <li class="mb-3">Members can download a <strong class="font-bold">printable PDF calendar</strong></li>
        <li class="mb-3">Meeting planner lets you see your unit meetings in one view and decide what to do at each meeting.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="py-4 w-3/4" id="more">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">What about Scoutbook?</h2>
      <p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">While
        there's a bit of overlap, Scoutbook covers different ground by focusing on advancement.
          Scoutplan is entirely focused on <strong class="font-bold">event management and communication</strong>.
          Together, the two make a potent combination.</p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">Scoutplan
        is free for Scouting America Packs, Troops, Crews, and Ships. The author funds the project for his unit's use. If it's beneficial to others, so much the better!</p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">Is it secure? Is it reliable?</h2>
      <p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">Yes and yes.

          Traffic is encrypted via TLS (formerly SSL) using certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>.
          We use <a href="https://honeybadger.io">Honeybadger</a> and <a href="https://scoutapm.com">Scout APM</a> to monitor errors and performance.
