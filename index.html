But then you're faced with the reality of what you <em>have</em> to do — sending emails, answering text messages, keeping track of who's coming to what event, maintaining your communication roster, updating calendars...it can be a lot.</p><p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">If you're like many units, you're probably using a collection of different tools to get the job done: Gmail, Google calendar, Excel, SignUpGenius, text messaging...great products on their own, but a hassle to manage, share access, and keep updated.</p><p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">Scoutplan is <strong class="font-bold">web software that's really good at those tedious tasks</strong>, freeing you to work on what people do best: delivering a great program. At a time when volunteers matter more than ever, let's make it easy to focus on what's most important. And because Scoutplan is made specifically for scouting, you can do a lot of things in one place, rather than stitching together a bunch of tools.</p><h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">What about Scoutbook?</h2><p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">While there's a bit of overlap, Scoutbook covers different ground by focusing on advancement. Scoutplan is entirely focused on <strong class="font-bold">event management and communication</strong>. Together, the two make a potent combination.</p><h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">How much does it cost?</h2><p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">Scoutplan is free for Scouts BSA packs, troops, crews, and ships. The author funds the project for his unit's use. If it's beneficial to others, so much the better!</p><h2 class="text-4xl font-black mb-4">Is it secure? Is it reliable?</h2><p class="leading-snug text-2xl font-light mb-8">Yes and yes. Scoutplan is hosted at <a href="https://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a>, a leading and secure cloud provider. Traffic is encrypted via TLS using certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>. We use <a href="https://honeybadger.io">Honeybadger</a> and <a href="https://scoutapm.com">Scout APM</a> to monitor errors and performance. Server configuration is checked weekly through <a href="https://ssllabs.com">Qualys SSL Labs</a>. As for reliability, Scoutplan was up and available 99.992% of the time in 2022, meaning it was down for less than one hour all year.</p></div></section><section class="border-t py-4" id="open_source_partners"><h3 class="text-center font-bold text-xl">With Gratitude: Our Open Source Partners</h3><div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items: center;"><div style="padding:2rem;"><a href="https://scoutapm.com"><img src="/assets/img/sapm_vert_logo-black.png" width="150" /></a></div><div style="padding:2rem;"><a href="https://honeybadger.io"><img src="/assets/img/honeybadger_logo.png" width="150" /></a></div><div style="padding:2rem;"><a href="https://github.com"><img src="/assets/img/GitHub_Logo.png" width="150" /></a></div></section></main></body></html>
