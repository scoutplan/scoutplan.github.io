Scoutplan lets you focus your communication. Event-based chat rooms include only the members who plan to attend. And, unlike text messages, Scoutplan chats are visible and archived, so your troop communication is safe and compliant.</p></p><h1>Automated reminders and notifications</h1><p>Scoutplan automatically sends reminders to parents and leaders, so you don't have to. And, you can customize the reminders to fit your troop's needs. For example, you can send a reminder to parents to bring a snack to the next meeting, or to leaders to bring a first aid kit to the next campout.</p><h1>Easy event planning</h1><p>Scoutplan makes it easy to plan events. You can create events in seconds, and invite parents and leaders to join the event chat room. You can also add event details, like the location, start and end times, and a description. And, you can add event tasks, like "Bring a first aid kit" or "Bring a snack".</p></main></body></html>
